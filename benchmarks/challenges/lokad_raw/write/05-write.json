    "question": "05-write - write several files using \"partitioned\" keyword\n\nThe keyword \"write\" introduces a block used to define a section of vectors, associated to a given table, to be persisted as a flat file stored in file hosting service named BigFiles. The contextual keyword \"partitioned\" modifies the behavior of the write block: several files can be written at once.\n\nConsider a table named Products where three vectors are defined:\n - Product\n - Color\n - Price\nStore the data in the Products table into several files partitioned by the Color vector on BigFiles in a clean repertory.\nUse a schema with columns \"Product\", \"Color\" and \"Price\" and a path schema that uses the Color vector for partitioning.",
    "answer": "table Products = with\n  [| as Product, as Color    , as Price |]\n  [| \"shirt\"   , \"white,grey\", 10.50    |]\n  [| \"pants\"   , \"blue\"      , 15.00    |]\n  [| \"hat\"     , \"red\"       , 5.25     |]\n\nschema Products with\n  Product : text\n  Color : text\n  Price : number\n\nschema '/clean/Products_{Color}.ion' with\n  schema Products\n\nwrite Products partitioned as '/clean/Products_{..}.ion'",
