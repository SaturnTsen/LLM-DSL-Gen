    "question": "///02-Const\n\n///The const keyword indicates that the value taken by a variable is known at compile time and that\n///it wonâ€™t change later at runtime. Those variables are primarily intended to control the files\n///being read.\n///Consider the file '/clean/tmp1/Catalog.ion' path schema which contains 2 columns:\n/// - a text \"UId\" uniquely identifying a product\n/// - a date \"LaunchDate\" tracking when the product was first launched.\n///The path schema is stored in a module \"/modules/PathSchemas\".\n///Store the path to the folder in a const variable and read the file using a path schema. Display the table.",
    "answer": "```envision\nimport \"/modules/PathSchemas\" as Schemas //modules use the import keyword\nconst path = '/clean/' //the path must be declared as a const to be used as a compile-time variable. Path schemas use single quote '' while regular path use double quotes \"\"\nread '\\{path}/Catalog.ion' as Catalog[id] with //\"id\" is the primary dimension of Catalog, based on \"UId\" in the file\n  id = Catalog.Uid //type is known from the schema. Realiasing from Uid to id.\n\nshow table \"Catalog\" with\n  id as \"id\"\n  Catalog.LaunchDate\n```",
