    "question": "01-Const\n\nThe const keyword indicates that the value taken by a variable is known at compile time and that it wonâ€™t change later at runtime. Those variables are primarily intended to control the files being read.\nConsider the file \"/clean/Catalog.ion\" which contains 2 columns:\n - a text \"UId\" uniquely identifying a product\n - a date \"LaunchDate\" tracking when the product was first launched.\nStore the path to the folder in a const variable and read the file using a regular path. Display the table.",
    "answer": "```nvn\nconst path = \"/clean/\" //the path must be declared as a const to be used as a compile-time variable. Path schemas use single quote '' while regular path use double quotes \"\"\nread \"\\{path}/Catalog.ion\" as Catalog[id] with //\"id\" is the primary dimension of Catalog, based on \"UId\" in the file\n  \"UId\" as id : text\n  LaunchDate : date\n\nshow table \"Catalog\" with\n  id as \"id\"\n  Catalog.LaunchDate\n```",
