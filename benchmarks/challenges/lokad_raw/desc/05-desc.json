When the scan takes a tuple, the desc option can be independently applied to every element of the tuple, i.e. scan [a desc, b, c desc].\n\nThe desc keyword is an option for a table tile block. When desc is present, the ordering of the table is inverted. When the order by takes a tuple as argument, the desc keyword can remain outside the tuple: order by [a, b, c] desc or applied individually inside the tuple to offer an ordering control over each element that makes the tuple: order by [a desc, b, c desc].\n\nConsidering the table Items as given below, display the table sorted by Damage in descending order, Cost in descending order.\n table Items = with\n   [| as Item,         as Cost,  as Damage,  as Strength      |]\n   [| \"Tango\",         90     ,    0       ,  0               |]\n   [| \"Observer ward\", 0      ,    0       ,  0               |]\n   [| \"Bracer\",        505    ,    0       ,  5               |]\n   [| \"Reaver\",        2700   ,    0       ,  25              |]\n   [| \"Divine rapier\", 5600   ,    100     ,  0               |]",
